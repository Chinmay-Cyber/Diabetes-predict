# Diabetes-predict
This code implements a machine learning approach for diabetes prediction. It first acquires and analyzes a dataset containing patient information. Subsequently, the code employs a Random Forest model to identify features that differentiate diabetic individuals from healthy individuals.
To ensure model effectiveness, the code employs a data splitting technique. This separates the dataset into training and testing sets. The model learns from the training set and its performance is evaluated using the independent testing set.
